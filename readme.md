# Talk to Me

I saw [this great tweet](https://twitter.com/LouisAnslow/status/1219643485902508036) the other day showing how kids communicate in schools by swapping out a single AirPod and using text to speech on Google Translate. Brilliant! Can't imagine the chaos that would've happened if this was a thing when I was in high school.

I was also playing around with the speech synthesis APIs of the browser to help a buddy out with a project of his. I figured I could make text to speech communication a little more seamless than G' Translate :grin:
